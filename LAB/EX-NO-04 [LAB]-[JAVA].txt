AIM:

	To write a Java program to find the sum and average of your tenth standard marks.

ALGORITHM:

	1)Start the program.
	2)Import the Scanner class to read input from the user (import java.util.Scanner;).
	3)Declare an integer array to store marks for 5 subjects.
	4)Initialize a variable sum to 0 to hold the total of marks.
	5)Create a Scanner object to read input from the user.
	6)Use a loop to read marks for each subject and store them in the array.
	7)Add each mark to sum inside the loop to calculate total marks.
	8)Calculate the average as average = sum / 5.0.
	9)Display the total marks and average marks to the user.
	10)End the program.


PROGRAM:

import java.util.Scanner;
class EX04 {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in);
        int marks[] = new int[5];
        int sum = 0;
        double aver;
        System.out.println("Enter your tenth standard marks one by one:");
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            System.out.print("Subject " + (i + 1) + ": ");
            marks[i] = s.nextInt();
            sum += marks[i];
        }
        aver = sum / 5.0;
        System.out.println("Total Marks: " + sum);
        System.out.println("Average Marks: " + aver);
    }
}

RESULT:

	Thus, the above Java program is executed successfully and the total and average marks are displayed.
