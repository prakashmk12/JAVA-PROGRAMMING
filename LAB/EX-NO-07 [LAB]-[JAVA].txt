					  USING METHOD OVERLOADING

AIM:

	To write a Java program to calculate area of rectangle, triangle and square using method overloading.

ALGORITHM:

	1)Start the program.
	2)Create a class Area with three overloaded findArea methods:
		•For rectangle (length × breadth).
		•For triangle (0.5 × base × height).
		•For square (side × side).
	3)In the main method, create an object of the Area class.
	4)Read the length and breadth of the rectangle.
	5)Call find Area for rectangle and store the result.
	6)Read the base and height of the triangle.
	7)Call find Area for triangle and store the result.
	8)Read the side of the square.
	9)Display the areas of the rectangle, triangle, and square.
	10)End the program.


PROGRAM:

import java.util.Scanner;
class Area {
    double findArea(double length, double breadth) {
        return length * breadth;
    }
    double findArea(double base, double height, boolean isTriangle) {
        return 0.5 * base * height;
    }
    double findArea(double side) {
        return side * side;
    }
}
class EXNO07 {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
        Area c = new Area();
        System.out.println("Enter Length and Breadth of Rectangle:");
        double le = scan.nextDouble();
        double br = scan.nextDouble();
        double rect = c.findArea(le, br);
        System.out.println("Enter Base and Height of Triangle:");
        double ba = scan.nextDouble();
        double ht = scan.nextDouble();
        double tri = c.findArea(ba, ht, true);
        System.out.println("Enter Side of Square:");
        double s = scan.nextDouble();
        double square = c.findArea(s);
        System.out.println("Area of the rectangle: " + rect);
        System.out.println("Area of the triangle: " + tri);
        System.out.println("Area of the square: " + square);
    }
}

RESULT:

	Thus, the above Java program is executed successfully and the areas of rectangle, triangle, and square are displayed.
