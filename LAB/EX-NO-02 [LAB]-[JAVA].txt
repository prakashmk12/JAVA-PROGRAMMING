EX.NO:02

			LARGEST NUMBER USING CONDITIONAL OPERATOR

AIM:

	To write a Java program to read 2 integers and find the largest number using conditional operator.

ALGORITHM:

	1)Start the program.
	2)Import the Scanner class.
	3)Create a Scanner object.
	4)Declare two integer variables.
	5)Declare a variable to store the largest number.
	6)Ask the user to enter two numbers.
	7)Read the two numbers from the user.
	8)Compare the numbers using the conditional operator.
	9)Display the largest number.
	10)End the program.


PROGRAM:

import java.util.Scanner;
public class EXNO02 {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        int a, b, big;
        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("Enter two numbers:");
        a = scan.nextInt();
        b = scan.nextInt();
        big = (a > b) ? a : b;
        System.out.println("Largest = " + big);
    }
}

RESULT:

	Thus, the above Java program is executed successfully and the largest number is displayed.
